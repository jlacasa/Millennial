I am a PhD student at Kansas State University. The purpose of this website is to communicate my research in the simplest way possible, so that people can get the most out of it. 

### A little bit about myself:
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I enjoy spending time with family and friends, sports, music, reading and cooking.
