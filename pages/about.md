I am a PhD student at Kansas State University. The purpose of this website is to communicate my research in the simplest way possible, so that people can get the most out of it. 
You will find news about my own publications and other I find interesting, plus some toughts about statistics and programming.

**Research interests:** crop physiology, cropping systems,Bayesian statistical modeling, and especially, the intersection between those.

#### A little bit about myself:
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I enjoy spending time with family and friends, sports, music, reading and cooking.
